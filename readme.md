=====================
**This library is no longer actively maintained. Pull requests with bug fixes will still be considered though. If you are an active user of the library and want to maintain it, open an issue and I'll transfer it over to you. There is an [alternative library from Felix Burns](https://github.com/fxb/php-last.fm-api) but it hasn't been updated since August 2013.**
